### Hello World !

This is a students project from the HfG @Schwäbisch Gmünd.
We designed and developed a colour-code game. With the generated data we worked on a colour generator with
machine learning (ml5).
You can play the game and with your personal ID you can start the generator.
Have fun and let us know if you like it!

Special thanks to @Hartmut Bohnacker, @Benedikt Groß, @Benjamin Lämmle
